# Word Sense Disambiguation

## Task Definition

The task of choosing the correct sense for a word is called word sense disambiguation (WSD). WSD algorithms take an input word *w* in its context with a fixed set of potential word senses S<sub>w</sub> of that input word and produce an output chosen from S<sub>w</sub>. In the isolated WSD task, one usually uses the set of senses from a dictionary or theasurus like WordNet. 

In the literature, there are actually two variants of the generic WSD task. In the lexical sample task, a small selected set of target words is chosen, along with a set of senses for each target word. For each target word *w*, a number of corpus sentences (context sentences) are manually labeled with the correct sense of *w*. In all-words task, systems are given entire sentences and a lexicon with the set of senses for each word in each sentence. Annotators are then asked to disambiguate every word in the text.

In all-words WSD, a classifier is trained to label the words in the text with their set of potential word senses. After giving the sense labels to the words in our training data, the next step is to select a group of features to discriminate different senses for each input word.

The following Table shows an example for the word 'yüz', which can refer to the number '100', to the verb 'swim' or to the noun 'face'.

|Sense|Definition|
|---|---|
|yüz<sup>1</sup> (hundred)|The number coming after ninety nine|
|yüz<sup>2</sup> (swim)|move or float in water|
|yüz<sup>3</sup> (face)|face, visage, countenance|

## Data Annotation

### Preparation

1. Collect a set of sentences to annotate. 
2. Each sentence in the collection must be named as xxxx.yyyyy in increasing order. For example, the first sentence to be annotated will be 0001.train, the second 0002.train, etc.
3. Put the sentences in the same folder such as *Turkish-Phrase*.
4. Build the [Java](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/WordSenseDisambiguation) project and put the generated sentence-semantics.jar file into another folder such as *Program*.
5. Put *Turkish-Phrase* and *Program* folders into a parent folder.

### Annotation

1. Open sentence-semantics.jar file.
2. Wait until the data load message is displayed.
3. Click Open button in the Project menu.
4. Choose a file for annotation from the folder *Turkish-Phrase*.  
5. For each word in the sentence, click the word, and choose correct sense for that word.
6. Click one of the next buttons to go to other files.

## Classification DataSet Generation

After annotating sentences, you can use [DataGenerator](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/DataGenerator-Cy) package to generate classification dataset for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

## Generation of ML Models

After generating the classification dataset as above, one can use the [Classification](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/Classification-Cy) package to generate machine learning models for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

Detailed Description
============

## ParseTree

In order to sense annotate a parse tree, one can use autoSemantic method of the TurkishTreeAutoSemantic class.

	parseTree = ...
	wordNet = WordNet()
	fsm = FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer()
	turkishAutoSemantic = TurkishTreeAutoSemantic(wordnet, fsm)
	turkishAutoSemantic.autoSemantic()

## Sentence

In order to sense annotate a parse tree, one can use autoSemantic method of the TurkishSentenceAutoSemantic class.

	sentence = ...
	wordNet = WordNet()
	fsm = FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer()
	turkishAutoSemantic = TurkishSentenceAutoSemantic(wordnet, fsm)
	turkishAutoSemantic.autoSemantic()

For Contibutors
============

### Setup.py file
1. Do not forget to set package list. All subfolders should be added to the package list.
```
    packages=['Classification', 'Classification.Model', 'Classification.Model.DecisionTree',
              'Classification.Model.Ensemble', 'Classification.Model.NeuralNetwork',
              'Classification.Model.NonParametric', 'Classification.Model.Parametric',
              'Classification.Filter', 'Classification.DataSet', 'Classification.Instance', 'Classification.Attribute',
              'Classification.Parameter', 'Classification.Experiment',
              'Classification.Performance', 'Classification.InstanceList', 'Classification.DistanceMetric',
              'Classification.StatisticalTest', 'Classification.FeatureSelection'],
```
2. Package name should be lowercase and only may include _ character.
```
    name='nlptoolkit_math',
```
3. Package data should be defined and must ibclude pyx, pxd, c and py files.
```
    package_data={'NGram': ['*.pxd', '*.pyx', '*.c', '*.py']},
```
4. Setup should include ext_modules with compiler directives.
```
    ext_modules=cythonize(["NGram/*.pyx"],
                          compiler_directives={'language_level': "3"}),
```

### Cython files
1. Define the class variables and class methods in the pxd file.
```
cdef class DiscreteDistribution(dict):

    cdef float __sum

    cpdef addItem(self, str item)
    cpdef removeItem(self, str item)
    cpdef addDistribution(self, DiscreteDistribution distribution)
```
2. For default values in class method declarations, use *.
```
    cpdef list constructIdiomLiterals(self, FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer fsm, MorphologicalParse morphologicalParse1,
                               MetamorphicParse metaParse1, MorphologicalParse morphologicalParse2,
                               MetamorphicParse metaParse2, MorphologicalParse morphologicalParse3 = *,
                               MetamorphicParse metaParse3 = *)
```
3. Define the class name as cdef, class methods as cpdef, and \_\_init\_\_ as def.
```
cdef class DiscreteDistribution(dict):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        """
        A constructor of DiscreteDistribution class which calls its super class.
        """
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.__sum = 0.0

    cpdef addItem(self, str item):
```
4. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    cpdef addItem(self, str item):
        """
        The addItem method takes a String item as an input and if this map contains a mapping for the item it puts the
        item with given value + 1, else it puts item with value of 1.

        PARAMETERS
        ----------
        item : string
            String input.
        """
```
5. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    cpdef addItem(self, str item):
```
6. Local variables should follow snake case.
```
	det = 1.0
	copy_of_matrix = copy.deepcopy(self)
```
7. Variable types should be defined for function parameters, class variables.
```
    cpdef double getValue(self, int rowNo, int colNo):
```
8. Local variables should be defined with types.
```
    cpdef sortDefinitions(self):
        cdef int i, j
        cdef str tmp
```
9. For abstract methods, use ABC package and declare them with @abstractmethod.
```
    @abstractmethod
    def train(self, train_set: list[Tensor]):
        pass
```
10. For private methods, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
    cpdef list __linearRegressionOnCountsOfCounts(self, list countsOfCounts)
```
11. For private class variables, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
cdef class NGram:
    cdef int __N
    cdef double __lambda1, __lambda2
    cdef bint __interpolated
    cdef set __vocabulary
    cdef list __probability_of_unseen
```
12. Write \_\_repr\_\_ class methods as toString methods
13. Write getter and setter class methods.
```
    cpdef int getN(self)
    cpdef setN(self, int N)
```
14. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
cdef class NGram:

    cpdef constructor1(self, int N, list corpus):
    cpdef constructor2(self, str fileName):
    def __init__(self,
                 NorFileName,
                 corpus=None):
        if isinstance(NorFileName, int):
            self.constructor1(NorFileName, corpus)
        else:
            self.constructor2(NorFileName)
```
15. Extend test classes from unittest and use separate unit test methods.
```
class NGramTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_GetCountSimple(self):
```
16. For undefined types use object as type in the type declarations.
```
cdef class WordNet:

    cdef object __syn_set_list
    cdef object __literal_list
```
17. For boolean types use bint as type in the type declarations.
```
	cdef bint is_done
```
18. Enumerated types should be used when necessary as enum classes, and should be declared in py files.
```
class AttributeType(Enum):
    """
    Continuous Attribute
    """
    CONTINUOUS = auto()
    """
```
19. Resource files should be taken from pkg_recources package.
```
	fileName = pkg_resources.resource_filename(__name__, 'data/turkish_wordnet.xml')
```
